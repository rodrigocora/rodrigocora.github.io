Hi, my name is Rodrigo and I'm an database administrator for about 9 years. I've worked mostly with Oracle but I also have some experience with MySQL/Mariadb/Percona Server.  
The main goal of this blog is to store scripts and tutorials that've helped me and maybe help some lost soul looking for solution for a problem I'd faced already. The second goal is to help me improve my English skills, so some errors are expected.
